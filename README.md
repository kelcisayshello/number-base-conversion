### Behind the math.
#### Decimal
> A **dec·i·mal** refers to any set of numbers which can be represented using infinite combination of the digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. Decimals are denoted with a log base of 10.
* 120 is a decimal
* 0 is also a decimal
* 0.23092 is actually also a decimal

#### Binary
> A **bi·na·ry** number refers to a number's representation using only 0's and 1's. Binary numbers have a log base of 2.
* 100 is the binary representation for 4
* 1 is the binary representation for 1
* 101011001 is the binary representation for 345

#### Hexadecimal
> A **hex·a·dec·i·mal** number refers to a number's representation using alphanumeric combinations of digits 0 through 9 and letters A through F (case insensitive). Hexadecimal numbers have a log base of 16.
